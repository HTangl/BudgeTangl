### DISCLAIMER ###  
The BudgeTangl is not compatible with the DIDIY board, the goal of this case is to be as cheap as possible which means using very few layers of material. Because it is so thin the DIDIY board will not fit. Please use the [DIDIY case](https://github.com/HTangl/DIDIY-Case) if you are buildng a controller using one of my DIY kits.  

The BudgeTangl is a budget oriented case design for a rectangle controller using the [HTangl layout](https://www.htangl.com/layout).  

I originally designed it to be built entirelely out of laser cut 3mm acrylic but you could use any material you want, MDF works particulary well and is a little bit cheaper.  

### Required layers (4 layers in total) ###
* Switchplate (3mm)
* 2x 3mm Middle Layers  OR  1 x 6mm middle layer
* Bottom Layer (3 mm)

The top layer (faceplate) is **OPTIONAL**

Also note there are alterante switch plate and top layer files if you would like switch holes for Select/Home buttons, if you only want the Start button use the normal switch plate and top layer files.    

You will need at least 6mm of room in the middle for all of the wiring, and the pico/arduino to fit so if you're using 3mm panels you'll need 2 middle layers and then a switchplate and bottom panel at the very minimum. 
You could also use a single 1/4in (6mm) panel for the middle layer and then a 3mm switch plate and bottom panel. There are many different ways you can configure your case and these are just a few examples. I have also included files for an optional top panel if you'd like the switches to sit lower in the case, this is not necessary but some people don't like the look of the switch sticking up high above the top of the case. 

You can send the DXF files in this repository to a laser cutting company like SendCutSend to get them cut. _joeyorton#7970_ on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/yAeFsbCDpv) also cuts these and sells kits including hardware and a model ud, DM him for details.  

The middle layers are cut to accept a [Model UD](https://github.com/HTangl/Model-UD). It's a dedicated USBC port that you wire your pico/arduino to which allows for the use of USBC to GC cables. You can buy them directly from a PCB manufacturer like JLCPCB or from me on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HTangl).  

For hardware you will need 6 M5 weld nuts and 6 M5 screws, the length of screw needed depends on what material you decide to use and how many layers you use.  

For example if you are using 4 layers of 3mm acrylic then 10mm screws will work perfectly.  

You can get screws and weld nuts from McMaster Carr or Amazon, I also sell them in individual packs on my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HTangl).
