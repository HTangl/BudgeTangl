The BudgeTangl is a budget oriented case design for a rectangle controller using the HTangl layout.  

I originally designed it be built entirelely out of laser cut 3mm acrylic but you could use any material you want.  

You can send the DXF files in the repository to a laser cutting company like SendCutSend to get them cut.  

The middle layers are cut to accept a [Model U breakout](https://github.com/HTangl/Model-U) board which where designed by [Crane](https://github.com/Crane1195/). You can buy them directly from a PCB manufacturer like JLCPCB or from me on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HTangl).

For hardware you will need 6 M5 weld nuts and 6 M5 screws, the length of screw needed depends on what material you decide to use and how many layers you use.  

For example if you are using 4 layers of 3mm acrylic then 12mm screws will work perfectly.  

You can get screws and weld nuts from McMaster Carr or Amazon, I also sell them in individual packs on my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HTangl).
