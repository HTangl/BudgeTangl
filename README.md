# BudgeTangl
 The BudgeTangl is a budget oriented case design for a rectangle controller using the HTangl layout.

I originally designed it be built entirelely out of laser cut 3mm acrylic but you could use any material you want.

You can send the DXF files in the repository to a laser cutting company like SendCutSend to get them cut.

The middle layers are cut to accept a Model U breakout board which where designed by Crane. You can buy them directly from a PCB manufacturer like JLCPCB or from me on Etsy.

For hardware you will need 6 M5 weld nuts and 6 M5 screws, the length of screw needed depends on what material you decide to use and how many layers you use.

For example if you are using 4 layers of 3mm acrylic then 12mm screws will work perfectly.
